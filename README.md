# CHAR
A "programming language" (not even close though) written in SPWN (no JS included), made with [charcodes](https://github.com/Unzor/spwn-charcodes)
# Examples
### Hello World
```
36-46-112-114-105-110-116-40-34-72-101-108-108-111-32-87-111-114-108-100-33-34-41
```

# Running
Running with SPWN v0.8 does not work. Instead, you have to use an unreleased and unstable version, which I have compiled. Download it [here](https://github.com/Unzor/spwn-unstables/releases/download/v1.0/spwn-unstables-setup.exe), and add "C:\Program Files (x86)\SPWN Unstables" to your PATH enviroment variables.
